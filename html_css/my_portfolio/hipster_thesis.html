    	<h1>Hipsters</h1>
    	<p class="first">By Harsh Patel</p>
    	<h2>Overview</h2>
    	<p class="second">The term was coined during the jazz age, when "hip" emerged as an adjective to describe aficionados of the growing scene.[10] Although the adjective's exact origins are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture%E2%80%9D">link</a> disputed, some say it was a derivative of "hop", a slang term for opium, while others believe it comes from the West African word hipi, meaning "to open one's eyes".[10] Another argument suggests the term derives from the practice of lying on one's hip while smoking opium.[15] The ultimate meaning of "hip", attested as early as 1902, is "aware" or "in the know". Conversely, the antonym unhip connotes those who are unaware of their surroundings, also including those who are opposed to hipness.</p>
    	<h2>What the Heck is a Hipster?</h2>
    	<p class="third">"Hipsters are the friends who sneer when you cop to liking Coldplay. They're the people who wear t-shirts silk-screened with quotes from movies you've never heard of and the only ones in America who still think Pabst Blue Ribbon is a good beer. They sport cowboy hats and berets and think Kanye West stole their sunglasses. Everything about them is exactingly constructed to give off the vibe that they just don't care."</p>
